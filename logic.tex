An argument is \textbf{valid} if and only if the truth of its premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. (i.e. there is no case in which all premises are true and the conclusion is false)
\\An argument is \textbf{vacuously valid} if and only if it is valid and has inconsistent premises.
\\An argument is \textbf{sound} if it is both valid and the premises are true.
\\An argument is \textbf{consistent} if and only if there is a case that all sentences are true.
\\An argument is \textbf{defeasibly valid} if and only if, if the premises are true, it's reasonable to expect the conclusion to be true as well.
\\A \textbf{counterexample} to an argument is a circumstance in which the premises are true and the conclusion is false.

		He must have gone to King's Pyland or to Mapleton
		\\\underline{He is not at King's Pyland}
		\\He is at Mapleton
	\item[B]
		The argument is not valid because having gone to King's Pyland or to Mapleton is not equivalent to being at King's Pyland or Mapleton. The first premise does not guarantee that He is eitehr at King's Pyland or at Mapleton, just that he must have gone to one of the two. For example, He could have gone to Mapleton and then gone to San Francisco. In this case, both premises are true and the conclusion is false. The argument is not sound because it is not valid.\\

		True, an argument is only made invalid if the conclusion is made false.
	\item
		False, if you remove false premises and leave true ones, then the argument can become invalid.
	\item
		O moving to either 1 or 7 would make no difference, since the two situations are equivalent after a simple translation.

	\item
		$(A \land B) \implies C$ \\
		There is a case where $(A \land B)$ are true but $C$ is false, therefore there is a case where the prepositions are true but the conclusion is false, making the argument invalid.\\
	\item
		There are no cases where $(A \land B)$ are true but $C$ is false, so $(A \land B) \implies C$ is always true.
		The argument A, B, therefore C is valid, therefore there is no case in which A and B are true but C is false, because A and B are premises and C is the conclusion. The only case in which $(A \land B)\implies C$ is false would be when $(A \land B)$ is true but $C$ is false, which we just established will never happen. Therefore, the statement $(A \land B) \implies C$ is always true.
